            <hr class="modalhr">
            Dispute resolution is one of our core practices. <br><br>
Litigation is sometimes inevitable and requires appropriate legal assistance. The choice of an adequate legal counsel can thus present a crucial element on which the outcome of the proceedings will depend upon. In that regard, we stand at the disposal of our clinets for all types of court proceedings they may find themselves in. <br><br>
We possess substantial experience in representing companies and inidividuals in complex and high-value litigation proceedings before the courts of the Republic of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. We consider that our knowledge and a thorough approach to every case is what makes us stand out.<br><br>
Besides litigation, we also regularly provide services to our clients in enforcement proceedings, as well as different types of non-litigious proceedings.<br><br>

            <hr class="modalhr">
                        Arbitration represents an out-of-court dispute resolution mechanizm which is most frequently used in cases having an international background. Due to very specific rules which drastically differ from those being applied in regular court proceedings, arbitration is an area which requires very specific expertise and experience. Having in mind that this form of dispute resolution is not largely applied in the area of former Yugoslavia, that kind of expertise and experience is a rarity in the region, meaning that the choice of appropriate legal counsel can be quite difficult.<br><br>
One of our most noticeable fields of expertise is precisely arbitration, in which we have very significant experience that proves it. Through academia, professional development both domestically and abroad, and then through successful representation of states and companies before international arbitral tribunals in cases of extremely high value and complexity, we have placed our sellves into the group of leading experts for this form of dispute resolution in the region. We especially pride ourselves with the fact that we had a crucial role in defending states of this region and their companies from claims that are over a billion euros in value.<br><br>
