        Galić Law was established with a desire to provide legal services of the highest quality and with the maximum dedication to each of its clients. After years of successful work on some of the most significant and valuable cases in the region of SEE, and beyond, the founder of the office has decided to start his own practice through which he tends to compete in quality and knowledge with the largest corporate law firms in this area.

        <p>
          Founder of the practice is the attorney at law Nemanja J. Galić. <br><br>
          Already as a student, he stood out for his remarkable academic accomplishments due to which he was the recipient of a number of awards and scholarships. He also achieved noticeable participations at several prestigious international moot court competitions in the area of both public and private international law – first as a team member, then as the coach, and lastly as one of the judges at these competitions.<br><br>
          One of his first contacts with the legal practice was a one-year internship with the team of defence of Ratko Mladić, which was a very high profile case before the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia. After his completed LLB studies (which he finished within the top 1% of his class), he simultaneously started an internship with a leading commercial law firm from Novi Sad, and was engaged academically with the International Law Department of the Novi Sad Faculty of Law, where he held lectures in Private International Law as a teaching assistant. At the same time, he also obtained his LLM degree at the same law school with excellent success, and went through additional professional training throughout the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.<br><br>
          In 2015, he goes on to Belgrade, to work for the leading international law firm in the SEE, where during the next four years he gains substantial professional experience in some of the most significant disputes and transactions in the region. During his work there, the dispute resolution department of this law firm was named as The International Arbitration Practice that Impressed the Most in the Past Year by Global Arbitration Review, due to a series of accomplished victories in international arbitration disputes in that period. During 2019, he transfers to the practically first highly specialized boutique law firm for dispute resolution in the region, where he continues with very successful work in the following years. At the end of 2020, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina names him as a member of the Legal team for the creation of the strategy of the legal protection of the interests of Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding the issues of disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel at the location of Trgovska Gora by Croatia. At the beginning of 2022, he decides to initiate his own independent practice. <br><br>  
          As someone who strives for continuous development and enhancement of knowledge, he is also currently pursuing his PhD degree at the Faculty of Law in Belgrade.
